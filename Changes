Revision history for X11-Muralis
================================

0.01 Sun 04 September 2005
--------------------------

  * (4 Sep 2005) tweaking documentation

  * (12 Jul 2005) renamed the module X11:Muralis

  * (12 Jul 2005) workaround Image::Info bug
  	It seems that with some JPEG files, the Image::Info module
  can't cope with them, even though xloadimage can display them
  perfectly well.  So, if Image::Info crashes, this now simply goes
  on to the display part.  This means that for those particular files,
  no smart guessing of the appropriate options will happen, but the
  user can still set their wanted options from the command line.

  * (9 May 2005) fixed tiling options

  * (9 May 2005) initial checkin
